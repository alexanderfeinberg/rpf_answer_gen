You are answering multiple RFP (Request for Proposal) questions using only the provided company documentation.

Below are the questions with their relevant documentation context:

{question}

Instructions:
1. Answer EACH question using ONLY the information from its provided documentation
2. Be specific and detailed - include relevant facts, numbers, certifications, processes
3. If the documentation does not contain enough information to answer a question, set that answer field to exactly:
   "No information was available to describe <question text>"
4. For each question, cite which sources you used (refer to [Source 1], [Source 2], etc.)
5. Assess your confidence based on how well the documentation addresses each question
6. Process all questions and return answers in the same order
7. Each "answer" value MUST be fewer than 600 characters

Return ONLY valid JSON (a list of answer objects) in this exact format (no markdown, no extra text):

[
  {{
    "question_id": 1,
    "answer": "Your detailed answer here, citing [Source 1] and [Source 2] as needed.",
    "confidence": "high|medium|low",
    "sources_used": [1, 2],
    "coverage": "full|partial|insufficient",
    "notes": "Any caveats or limitations in the answer (optional)"
  }},
  {{
    "question_id": 2,
    "answer": "Another detailed answer...",
    "confidence": "high|medium|low",
    "sources_used": [1, 3],
    "coverage": "full|partial|insufficient",
    "notes": ""
  }}
]

Confidence levels:
- "high": Documentation directly and comprehensively addresses the question
- "medium": Documentation addresses the question but may lack some details
- "low": Documentation only partially addresses or doesn't address the question

Coverage levels:
- "full": Question is completely answered with documentation
- "partial": Question is partially answered, some aspects missing
- "insufficient": Documentation doesn't adequately address the question

Important:
- Do NOT include markdown code blocks (no ```json)
- Do NOT include any explanatory text before or after the JSON
- Return ONLY the raw JSON array
- Ensure all JSON is valid (proper quotes, escaping, etc.)
- The output array MUST contain the same number of answers as input questions
- Each answer MUST include the correct question_id
- It is imperative that every input question is associated with exactly one answer object
- Each answer's "answer" text must be < 600 characters
- If needed, shorten wording while preserving key facts and keep valid JSON for every item
