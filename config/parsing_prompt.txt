You are extracting questions from an RFP (Request for Proposal) document.

Your task:
1. Identify ALL questions that require answers from the vendor
2. Include both explicit questions (ending with "?") and implicit questions (e.g., "Describe your...", "Provide details on...", "Explain how...")
3. Preserve the original wording exactly as written
4. Assign a sequential number to each question starting from 1
5. Each question "text" MUST be fewer than 600 characters

Return ONLY valid JSON in this exact format, with no additional text or markdown:

{
  "questions": [
    {
      "number": 1,
      "text": "What is your company's experience with cloud security?"
    },
    {
      "number": 2,
      "text": "Describe your incident response procedures."
    }
  ]
}

Important:
- Do NOT include any markdown code blocks (no ```json)
- Do NOT include any explanatory text before or after the JSON
- Return ONLY the raw JSON object
- Every question "text" must be < 600 characters
- If a question exceeds 600 characters, rewrite it to a concise equivalent that preserves intent and stays < 600 characters
